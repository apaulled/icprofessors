She did her undergraduate study in Philadelphia at Moore College of Art and Design, receiving a BFA, and subsequently moved to New York City where she received her MFA from the New York Academy of Art. Amber has been awarded the Elizabeth Greenshields Foundation Grant, the Constance Saltonstall Foundation Grant, and the Stobart Foundation Grant for her work. During graduate school she was awarded a Prince of Wales/Forbes Foundation Travel Grant and Residency, and during undergraduate school she received the Emily Sartain Fellowship for European Travel.",

Her major influences range from Johannes Vermeer to Edward Hopper to Alice Neel, and while there is a tendency towards voyeurism in her work, it is countered by an element of confrontation.",

My research objectives are threefold: 1) Investigating how individuals navigate the complex interplay of competition, tolerance, and cooperation while living in complex social groups; 2) Understanding the relationship between vulnerability to and presence of infectious disease and primate health; and 3) Using molecular primatology to investigate the extent to which genetic relatedness impacts individual fitness and social structure, as well as to examine the genetic population structure within fragmented primate populations like La Pacifica.

Further, we became especially interested in the phenomenon of sex ratio distortion, where certain females would produce almost exclusively female offspring, others produced almost exclusively male offspring, and some produced relatively unbiased clutches.\u00a0 There are many possible causes: one is where sex-ratio distorting pathogens infect the host organisms and skew the sex ratio for their own benefit, given that many of these pathogens can only be transmitted down maternal lineages.\u00a0 Subsequently, we investigated whether there were known sex-ratio distorting pathogens infecting Arrenurus spp. water mites, and found species of Cardinium, Spiroplasma, and Rickettsia. \u00a0 Yet another line of research, I have recently become interested in molecular evolution in this group of mites, particularly involving the COI sequence used for genetic 'bar coding' of species.\u00a0 Retirement has provided me with much more free time in which to pursue my research on water mites.\u00a0 I intend to continue for many years to come.",

                "Durable materials are essential to the widespread introduction of fuel cell technology. A key challenge in the manufacture of stable polymer electrode membrane (PEM) fuel cells is corrosion of the carbon black cathode supports. Carbon black reacts to form CO2\u00a0at high potentials, often achieved during start-up and shut-down conditions. New materials that could replace carbon black are transition-metal-doped titanium and tin dioxides.\u00a0The rutile structure exhibits excellent flexibility in doping it with transition metals such as tungsten.\u00a0Titanium dioxide (TiO2)\u00a0and tin dioxide (SnO2) are two rutile-type compounds that are stable and inexpensive, but non-conducting. We make TiO2\u00a0and SnO2 conducting by substituting tungsten, molybdenum and other transition metal cations in place of some of the titanium or tin cations. Substituted compounds with stoichiometries Ti1-x-y AxByO2, (where A = W, Mo, Ta, Nb, and B = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) have been synthesized using chemical vapor transport (CVT). Many of the substituted oxides maintain the rutile structure, are conducting, and are stable in acid solutions. We're currently synthesizing doped tin oxides using CVT and sol-gel methods. We characterize our compounds by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence and by resistivity measurements.\u00a0 Our goal is stable,\u00a0electrically conducting materials that will be useful for a wide variety of applications such as cathode supports in fuel cells.",

Students, classroom teachers, and I have jointly presented research at national and international conferences or co-authored research papers and book chapters as a result of our collaborative work.

                "Joining the English Department at Ithaca College has proven to be one of the most rewarding experiences in my academic career. Since my arrival in 2012, I have taught courses ranging from a 100-level survey of American literature, to a course focused on narratives of racial passing in American literature, to a course on Black Women writers in the post-Civil Rights era. With the support of my colleagues, I taught an African American literature survey (Spring '14) \u00a0in conjunction with my good friend, Dr. Tom Nurmi, who taught the same course that semester at Elmira College. Our students shared readings, gave group presentations, and were partnered up into writing workshop groups to critique one another's written work.\u00a0We hosted\u00a0\"movie night\" at IC midway through the semester that gave our students an opportunity to meet face-to-face and chat casually over pizza.\u00a0The most entertaining course thus far has been my\u00a0Ithaca Seminar which\u00a0focuses\u00a0on the persistence of racial, gendered, sexual, and socioeconomic discrimination through stereotypes\u00a0in a country\u00a0deeply invested in postracial rhetoric. We utilize short stories, op-ed pieces, TV interviews, websites, advertisements, personal essays, and paintings to debunk the notion that these forms of discrimination have ceased to exist or no longer matter. The in-class discussions are entertaining, yet powerful, and the students enrolled in this class regularly demonstrate what I have always known to be true - that they are a generation of creative, innovative, mature, and insightful young scholars ready to tackle the difficult challenges of this century.",
                "The faculty in my department\u00a0also strongly support\u00a0me in accomplishing my research goals. As someone with a wide array of\u00a0research interests\u00a0- the redefinition of African American literature in the context of post-racial discourse, hip-hop's impact\u00a0on global societies and social movements, and\u00a0reappropriating the concept of the \"student-athlete\" in higher education,\u00a0for instance\u00a0- and who needs to continue developing as a writer,\u00a0I am always spying\u00a0forums to have my work critiqued. Thankfully, the junior faculty cohort has\u00a0invited me to join their\u00a0writing group, becoming a human sounding board for me to work out some of the complexities of my research. As a result, they helped me wrap up a project on Robert Downey Jr's\u00a0use of blackface in the film\u00a0Tropic Thunder,\u00a0published in Robert Downey Jr. from Brat to Icon (2014),\u00a0and were instrumental in pushing me to complete a book chapter on ZZ Packer's short story \"Drinking Coffee Elsewhere\" that has been included in the collection Neo-Passing: Performing Identity After Jim Crow (2018).\u00a0I have received some of the best possible constructive feedback on my work while enjoying baked goods,\u00a0frothy beverages, and even lighthearted conversation. Very quickly, my colleagues have also become some of my truest, closest friends.",

I focus primarily on British and Irish literature of the long 18th century, but with a comparative and transnational approach that invariably delves into other traditions as well.

I argue against the standard narrative of the novel's rise on two fronts, arguing that the focus on Anglo-French fiction, on the one hand, and realism, on the other, gives us an overly narrow sense of the novel's potential, and skews our readings of fiction from \"other\" parts of the world. I use close readings of pairs of books from Poland and Ireland, spanning the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries, to demonstrate how mainstream theories of the novel fail to engage their most innovative features, because they do not conform to emerging conventions of realist fiction. Examining the features of these works that have been seen as deviations from the novel's teleology, such as satire, interlaced tales, or the use of the supernatural, I present them as efforts to theorize the potential of the form; investigations of the novel's world-building powers.",

                "My current book project,\u00a0Land and Literacies in Medieval Britain, shows how the management of the land is both a material precondition for and an obsession of medieval British reading and writing. The years between 1000 and 1400 saw major social and ecological changes, including the climatic transition from the medieval warm period to the Little Ice Age. Each century saw different literary efforts to sustain the fiction that the land\u2019s productivity as well as its social meanings were constant and manageable. Medieval elites had deep interests in organizing land and books into meaning together, but so did other, less conventionally literate populations.Land and Literacies\u00a0shows how different languages negotiated different meanings for land, in frequently complex and unpredictable ways. Peasant populations in the 1300s, for example, used their contingent Latinity as a tool to assert their ability to determine the the social and historical meanings of the land they worked, while English-speaking aristocratic populations a century earlier taught their children the French words for the tools of agricultural labor as a strategy of eliteness maintenance. The book discusses texts in Latin, Old English, Anglo-Norman French, Middle English, Middle Welsh, or, often, a combination of these languages. I'm also working on translating medieval poetry about labor conflicts from Latin, and I am always trying to figure out how medieval forms of meaning-making can help us understand our own world.",

If students do not graduate from Ithaca College with an understanding of the dimensions (which includes profound injustice) and challenges of this crisis we face, and with some skills and aptitudes to adapt to and (when possible) mitigate the crisis, then we have failed them.

                "ARCHAEOLOGY: My research interests are all focused on the interaction between people and their environments through the lens of food\u2013related activities. Because food systems are\u00a0a direct reflection of both availability and cultural choice, the analysis of\u00a0food remains can provide important clues about interrelationship between prehispanic populations and their environments. Since 1990 I have been part of a team of archaeologists excavating at\u00a0La Quemada\u00a0in the\u00a0Malpaso Valley of Zacatecas, Mexico. This is an interesting region\u00a0to study food systems\u00a0because the amount of rainfall is, at best, marginal for adequate agricultural production. So this region could provide\u00a0a great case study in human responses to climate change from a long-term perspective.",
                "DENDROCHRONOLOGY:\u00a0Research in this region is impeded by two things, precise measures of time to date cultural changes, and climate\u00a0reconstructions at high enough resolution\u00a0to assess the variability of environmental conditions over space and time. With the goal of addressing both these obstacles, my most recent research uses dendroarchaeology, a combination of tree-ring analysis and 14C-dating, to construct a high resolution tree-ring sequence that can be used to precisely date wood found at archaeogical sites. Together with students from Ithaca College, and\u00a0in\u00a0collaboration\u00a0with researchers from the\u00a0Tree-Ring Laboratory at Cornell University\u00a0, we\u00a0are collecting and studying prehistoric and historic wooden beams from\u00a0northern Mesoamerica with the goal of developing a chronological sequence that extends back from present to the 4th century A.D.\u00a0 Go to this\u00a0LINK\u00a0for an overview of our preliminary findings of Phase I of this project. By providing a deep time example\u00a0of a society\u00a0that may have been forced to adapt to unpredictable and fragile environmental conditions, this research has broad relevance to the rapid environmental changes we\u00a0are struggling with today.",
                "AQUAPONICS: While conventional food production methods produce large amounts of food, they also produce agricultural waste, deplete the soils, add chemical runoff to natural water sources, and take up large expanses of land.\u00a0 In contrast,\u00a0integrated agricultural systems, like aquaponics, are developed on the philosophy of mimicking nature's systems to create productive agriculture with minimum input and close to zero waste. Aquaponics uses\u00a0fish waste, which is naturally convertible to a form of nitrogen, to\u00a0nourish plants. Since the inception of the Ithaca College\u00a0Aquaponics Research Project, more than 40 students have conducted research to evaluate the ability of aquaponics to efficiently produce healthy food in a commercially and environmentally sustainable setting\u00a0and, as a bonus, has provided students and faculty with fresh herbs, fish (tilapia), and produce.\u00a0Here is a link to the\u00a0Ithaca College Project\u00a0with details on some of the student projects.",
                "What, you ask, does aquaponics have to do with Mesoamerican prehistory?\u00a0\u00a0Actually, aquaponics has it roots in a\u00a0technology called\u00a0chinampa\u00a0agriculture, which was used in Mesoamerica as the source of much of the food consumed by the Aztecs. The nutrient dense organics deposited by fish and plant debris in the canals was\u00a0used to fertilize the surrounding the raised fields. \u00a0These fields were so productive\u00a0that they could often harvest three crops on the same plot each year! \u00a0The connection between these two technologies is an example of the topics we address in my class \"Contemporary Applications of Ancient Agriculture\"."

In the fall of 1992, I moved to Syracuse to pursue graduate work in Mathematics and completed an M.S. in mathematics, in 1994, at Syracuse University. Continuing at SU, I finished a Ph.D. in Mathematics in probability theory (stochastic processes) and a second M.S. in Applied Statistics, in May of 1999. In August of 1999 we, moved to the Twin Ports (Duluth, MN and Superior, WI), and I started a position as an assistant professor of mathematics at University of Wisconsin Superior. After two fun years in the Twin Ports, we\u00a0moved \"back east\" to Ithaca, NY\u00a0where I am now a professor of mathematics.\u00a0Over the next couple of years, we had our third and fourth sons.",

                "I specialize in political philosophy, ethics, and the philosophy of religion.\u00a0 Here at Ithaca College, I have created several courses, such as\u00a0Global Ethics, Philosophical Problems in the Law, Difference and Community (a course on multiculturalism and toleration), as well as the first-year seminars Dilemmas of the Future (on technology ethics), The Nature of the Self, and On Human Rights.\u00a0 My current research interests lie in exploring issues connected with Pascal\u2019s Wager (a pragmatic argument for belief in God, of which I am critical), in exploring moral theories rooted in an ideal of respect for human dignity, and in exploring the relevance for justice of the fact that a person's wealth is generated, not by that person acting alone, but by that person acting in concert with others within a functioning \"social order.\"",
                "When I am not doing philosophy, I can be found spending time with my family and friends, listening to music, hiking and traveling and sampling new cuisines, and\u00a0playing card games\u00a0and strategy games."

I will be presenting at the 7th biannual conference of the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism, to be held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, from July 2-4, 2019.

                "Abstracts for both papers",
                "Visionary religious experience in the Hekhalot literature",
                "The Jewish Hekhalot literature, dated from the 4th to the 7th centuries CE (Palestine and Babylonia), has two main focuses: instructions for and descriptions of ascents (also called descents) to the Merkabah (the heavenly chariot-throne of God), and detailed instructions to invoke high angels (e.g., Metatron) to descend to earth and obey the one who adjures them. The term hekhal originally referred to an inner chamber of the Jerusalem Temple, but in this literature the hekhalot are the heavenly temples/palaces of God and the angels closest to him. The ascent/descent is accomplished by several means, including the recital of hymns in praise of God and adjurations of angels. Adjurations of angels to descend to earth are accomplished by pronouncing the names of God and the angels. The principal goal of the ascent/descent to the Merkabah is for the human being to enter the divine throne-room and participate in the praise of God together with the angels. The goal of the invocation of angels is to gain revelatory wisdom and power over them.",
                "The Hekhalot literature as whole, therefore, defies the conventional distinction between magic and mysticism, as mystical goals can be attained through magical means. This literature, at the time of its composition, was largely esoteric in audience (limited to a small number of learned men), although there is evidence that aspects of it were more widely known (as shown by the use of passages from the Hekhalot literature in the Babylonian incantation bowl texts). This paper will discuss the visionary experiences of God and the angels in this literature and how they might be understood as \u201cextraordinary religious experiences,\u201d in particular addressing the question of whether and how it is possible to gain knowledge of the nature of these experiences through the examination of instructional and literary texts.",
                "Demons, Evil, and Illness in the Babylonian Incantation Bowls",
                "Many types of demons, both named and unnamed, appear as threats to human beings in the inscriptions on the Babylonian incantation bowls. These are earthenware bowls discovered in archaeological excavations in Iraq, and usually dated to the later Sasanian and early Islamic periods (5th-8th centuries CE). Most inscriptions are written in Babylonian Jewish Aramaic, with a smaller number in Syriac and Mandaic, although the names of most of the clients are Persian. The paper will focus on the bowls with known provenances, but when bowls without known provenance are discussed, they will be flagged.",
                "This paper will examine how the incantations on the bowls depict the varieties of demons, both named and unnamed, who cause an array of evil occurrences, including illness and death, to women, men, and children. Most of the bowls function to protect the people named upon them, and the paper will focus on this type to the exclusion of aggressive texts where the demons are directed to injure other people.",
                "Questions the paper will address include: how do the bowls describe the ills, both physical and psychological, that befall people? In which instances do the demons cause particular illnesses (like migraine), and when do they threaten death, especially to children? How do the demons destroy relationships between people, especially between husband and wife? Are there gender or age differences among the dangers the demons offer to men, women, and children, or are they mostly common dangers? How do the incantations conceive of the spatial locations of the demons \u2013 are they located in the body, in the house, within the larger household, or outside the home area? How closely must they approach in order to endanger people? The goal of the paper is to construct a taxonomy of the dangers demons offered to human beings in late antique Babylonia."

                "Although communism was officially over, more than half of the curriculum at the University still was Marxist philosophy.\u00a0 When not reading Marx and Lenin, we still had to think as Marxists: the goal was never to assess or critically to evaluate a philosophical position, but rather to understand its historical context, and the \u2018basis\u2019 on which it was founded (as part of the \u2018superstructure\u2019).\u00a0 When I came to study at an American university (it was through a \u2018study abroad\u2019 program), I fell in love with the Anglophone tradition \u2013 from Bertrand Russell and Isaiah Berlin, to John Rawls and Bernard Williams. \u00a0To my relief, I was also good at doing philosophy analytically (and much better than I was at Marxist analysis)!",
                "Today, I think I owe much to both traditions:\u00a0 \u00a0my areas of philosophical interest are essentially within the umbrella of history of philosophy, but I do history of philosophy with the hope of learning from it.\u00a0 I work primarily on Kant, and within Kant \u2013 on his political and his ethical theory, together with (roughly) the second half of the Critique of Pure Reason.\u00a0 When I study Kant, it is with a look historically \u2018forward\u2019 (toward the XIX-C philosophy) rather than \u2018backward\u2019 (to Early Modern thought).\u00a0 Thus, my research and teaching usually extends to German Idealism, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Marx (read analytically!), and even as far as Existentialism and contemporary political thought."

The memory for emotional stimuli has long been found to differ from the memory for neutral stimuli. However, emotion's influence is now understood to be more complicated than purely a mechanism for enhancing memory.\u00a0 Several current researchers now contend that enhanced memory for emotional stimuli is actually mediated via the combination of several additional variables known to influence memory independent of any emotional significance (e.g., increased relatedness, attention and distinctiveness). Most commonly, our research fails to find that emotion enhances recognition memory accuracy and instead finds that the most robust influence is elevated false memory for emotional material. My research team and I conduct experimental research designed to assess if the variables forwarded to moderate and mediate emotion's influence on memory accuracy, and the respective theories, extend to emotion's influence on false memory formation."

Originally from San Antonio, TX, Belisa Gonz\u00e1lez earned her PhD in Sociology from Emory University in 2006. While in Atlanta, she was a member and co-chair of the Atlanta Organizing Committee (AOC) for Undoing Racism. It was her experience with the organizers on AOC and others like it that formed the basis of her dissertation \u201cIncreasing Collaboration or Conflict,\u201d which focused on sustainable cross racial organizing efforts between African Americans and Latinos in the South. Her role as an organizer and co-facilitator of quarterly Undoing Racism workshops helped her better understand interweaving systems of oppression and their consequences on everyday lives, the power of community and the importance of taking leadership from marginalized peoples.\u00a0 After completing her degree at Emory Belisa held a one year postdoc at the University of Georgia, before accepting a position in the Sociology department at Ithaca College (IC) in 2007.",
                "Her teaching and research focus on inter and intra group relations between and within communities of color in the U.S. Her past research investigated the intergroup dynamics within cross-racial organizing efforts between African Americans and Latina/os organizing in Atlanta. Using data collected from a four-year NSF-funded study co-investigated with Irene Browne of Emory University, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez is currently exploring how middle-class Dominican and Mexican immigrants living in Atlanta experience discrimination. Along with her co-PI, Dr. Sean Eversley Bradwell, she completed a three-year assessment of Multicultural Resource Center\u2019s Talking Circles.",
                "For 10 years (2008 - 2018), Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez ran the Urban Mentorship Initiative (UMI), a distance mentorship program that paired 7th\u00a0grade students from MS50 El Puente, located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY with students from Ithaca College. The program was designed to expose El Puente students to college life while introducing IC students to the structural and interpersonal realities of being social change agents. In addition to their interactions with the students from El Puente, UMI mentors were required to enroll in Practicum for Social Change. The content of the course was a balance between material on interlocking structural inequality and strategies for how to make the world a more just and equitable place.",

                "I grew up in a small town on the plains of western Oklahoma near the banks of the Canadian River, near where my father's parents and grandparents homesteaded early in the last century. Winters are cold and dry there, but relatively short; springs are exciting with their new growth and the frequent tornadic eruptions; summers hot and dry\u00a0of course, but the\u00a0evening\u00a0sunsets are spectacular,\u00a0as if painted by an overzealous child artist; and autumns, once past the heat of summer, are long and mild--every season lots of sun, breath-taking winds, and of course enormous skies.",
                "I took a B.A. in English and Philosophy from Oklahoma State University in '79 and then worked odd jobs for a while--dishwasher, waiter, liquor store manager, social services secretary in Boulder, Colorado--before returning to school to study more literature, philosophy, and creative writing. But that took a while too, before providing a settled life, a year in this graduate school, another in that. Then came Ithaca and I fell in love with it,\u00a0particularly with the M.F.A. program at Cornell, happy to be studying with\u00a0Archie Ammons and Robert Morgan. I taught at Cornell for two more years after graduation and then roamed around the Northeast\u00a0teaching at\u00a0Hudson Valley community colleges and then at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute--before coming back to Ithaca to take a position in the Writing Program here and settle down with my family. I'm proud to have been a part of our faculty in the 90s that molded\u00a0a bona fide Department from our Program, and to now offer a B.A. as interesting and varied in its offerings as ours is.",
                "Regarding teaching, I discovered over the years that my ultimate goal in teaching was to instill in my students an intellectual generosity, I would like to think primarily by modeling it, to be less interested in espousing knowledge\u00a0than in encouraging\u00a0a particular attitude toward knowledge, expansive and open-armed. I taught\u00a0a variety of courses over the years: a freshman seminar on the philosophy and science of sex and love; personal essay writing; poetry writing; a 300-level Poetics course that covers the history of ideas from Thales to Foucault through the lens of creative writing theory; a senior seminar workshop on the practice, history, and theory of traditional poetry forms; and three honors seminars, one on the philosophy and science of sex and love, another on the pursuit of happiness, and another on Western concepts of the self since the Renaissance.",
                "In addition to publishing poems, I've published several essays, most recently a 2022 piece in Journal of Narrative Politics and a book-length\u00a0piece on the pursuit of happiness\u00a0in the 2019 proceedings for the conference on\u00a0Arts, Humanities,\u00a0Social Sciences & Education, in Hawaii. My essay \"The Sick Rose: Some Problems with the Self\" came out in the spring '18 issue of\u00a0Writing on the Edge, an essay that explains the history of the role of the self mostly as it has played out in Western literature since the Renaissance. An autobiographical essay came out in\u00a0Journal of Narrative Politics in fall '16,\u00a0and appearing a few weeks earlier was\u00a0an epilogue I was invited to write, to\u00a0Narrative Global Politics: Theory, History and the Personal in International Relations. My essay\u00a0\"Thoughts on the Metaphysics of American White Racism\" appeared that same year in\u00a0Journal of Narrative Politics. In 2013, my personal essay \"Compliance\" was published in\u00a0South\u00a0Loop Review and\u00a0was a top-three finalist in\u00a0Missouri Review's\u00a02013 essay contest."

These courses serve not only students in the professions and sciences but also local businesses, government agencies, and nonprofits.

Descended from medieval and Renaissance chancery clerks and secretaries, he has published articles on such literary figures as Bacon, Cicero, Defoe, Machiavelli, and Kafka in the Journal of Technical Writing and Communication\u00a0(JTWC) and coedited and contributed chapters to Design Discourse: Composing and Revising the Professional and Technical Writing Program (Parlor Press/ WAC Clearinghouse, 2010).

                "My earliest memories of acquiring an education was on my Azorean parents' dairy farm in California where I learned to save my fingers while milking calves, locate the lone bull in a cow pen, and snap haywire with one lemon squeeze and violent twist. Years later, my education extended to the classrooms of California State University, Fresno. As an English major, I pursued my interests in poetry, which really emerged from my interests in Pink Floyd. In January 2000, I started the M.F.A. program in poetry and later switched to nonfiction prose after the lines in my poems started metamorphosizing into sentences and paragraphs.",
                "While I pursued my M.F.A., I became equally intrigued by composition theory and pedagogy. I loved language and the socio-cognitive processes of writing, so I wanted my students to share this experience. In 2003, I graduated with my M.F.A. and a certificate in Advanced Study of Composition. From 2003 to 2006, I worked with emergent writers from divergent socio-cultural and socio-economic backgrounds in the Fresno area. My students challenged me in amazing ways to co-construct a curricular design that allowed students to think critically, develop their voice, and write with purpose. However, I did not settle there. I questioned my pedagogical methods, student outcomes, and theoretical implications. What I did not realize at the time was that I was thinking like a researcher without knowing exactly how one goes about doing actual research. I wanted to find answers to my clumsy inquiries and experiments. In fall 2006, I sat in my first Ph.D. classroom at University of California, Santa Barbara. I was the first in my immediate and extended family, including our local Portuguese community, to pursue a Ph.D. In June 2011, I walked right out with my degree in Education with an emphasis in Language, Literacy, and Compositions Studies. In the last eleven years, I have been known as the \"technology professor,\" because of my use of digital learning tools and technologies in the classroom. My goal is to transform what it means to learn to write in the 21st century and design learning environments that allow students to participate and collectively construct new knowledge to solve or re-imagine contemporary problems.",
