        "My research addresses questions about the evolutionary history of plants. To answer such questions, I and my research students analyze plant DNA. Molecular systematics\u00a0is\u00a0the use of DNA (and other molecules)\u00a0to reconstruct phylogenies (our best guesses of evolutionary history). We\u00a0have used molecular systematics to study the evolutionary relationships among different species of plants\u00a0in the order Cucurbitales \u00a0(cucumbers,\u00a0squashes, begonias, and a few other smaller plant families). We are also using DNA at the level of populations to study small-scale evolution within a species.\u00a0Population\u00a0genetics\u00a0is the use of genetic information to characterize the\u00a0variation that exists in populations.",
        "The questions that most intrigue me are evolutionary ones. For example, how did Hillebrandia (a begonia) come to exist in Hawaii and nowhere else?\u00a0How did bacterial symbioses in plant roots\u00a0evolve? How do plants and their parasites co-evolve? \u00a0More recently, my students and I have begun to look at the question of how species evolve\u00a0on islands. We are\u00a0characterizing the genetic variation in the inkberry (Scaevola plumieri) in Puerto Rico using microsatellites as a way to understand how this native species might be impacted by a closely related invasive species (Scaevola taccada).",

        "My research has primarily focused on the resources linguistically and culturally diverse children bring to literate events, although I also conduct research on teacher-inquiry and pedagogies of equity. Over time, I have developed a particular interest in how young children understand issues of race, class, and faith. Classroom read-alouds have been valuable spaces in which teachers and I have been able to learn more about how children\u2019s understandings of these topics are developing, how their inquiries into these topics are mediated, and how children use these understandings to support their emerging literary understandings. I have also participated in multiple teacher-inquiry communities, exploring methods to combat homophobia and heterosexism in classrooms and finding ways to better understand and increase the engagement of quiet or reluctant students. Students, classroom teachers, and I have jointly presented research at national and international conferences or co-authored research papers and book chapters as a result of our collaborative work. I\u00a0welcome inquiries from IC students or local classroom teachers interested in exploring applications of social, critical, and experiential theories of reader response and/or qualitative practitioner-research together.",

        "Joining the English Department at Ithaca College has proven to be one of the most rewarding experiences in my academic career. Since my arrival in 2012, I have taught courses ranging from a 100-level survey of American literature, to a course focused on narratives of racial passing in American literature, to a course on Black Women writers in the post-Civil Rights era. With the support of my colleagues, I taught an African American literature survey (Spring '14) \u00a0in conjunction with my good friend, Dr. Tom Nurmi, who taught the same course that semester at Elmira College. Our students shared readings, gave group presentations, and were partnered up into writing workshop groups to critique one another's written work.\u00a0We hosted\u00a0\"movie night\" at IC midway through the semester that gave our students an opportunity to meet face-to-face and chat casually over pizza.\u00a0The most entertaining course thus far has been my\u00a0Ithaca Seminar which\u00a0focuses\u00a0on the persistence of racial, gendered, sexual, and socioeconomic discrimination through stereotypes\u00a0in a country\u00a0deeply invested in postracial rhetoric. We utilize short stories, op-ed pieces, TV interviews, websites, advertisements, personal essays, and paintings to debunk the notion that these forms of discrimination have ceased to exist or no longer matter. The in-class discussions are entertaining, yet powerful, and the students enrolled in this class regularly demonstrate what I have always known to be true - that they are a generation of creative, innovative, mature, and insightful young scholars ready to tackle the difficult challenges of this century.",
        "The faculty in my department\u00a0also strongly support\u00a0me in accomplishing my research goals. As someone with a wide array of\u00a0research interests\u00a0- the redefinition of African American literature in the context of post-racial discourse, hip-hop's impact\u00a0on global societies and social movements, and\u00a0reappropriating the concept of the \"student-athlete\" in higher education,\u00a0for instance\u00a0- and who needs to continue developing as a writer,\u00a0I am always spying\u00a0forums to have my work critiqued. Thankfully, the junior faculty cohort has\u00a0invited me to join their\u00a0writing group, becoming a human sounding board for me to work out some of the complexities of my research. As a result, they helped me wrap up a project on Robert Downey Jr's\u00a0use of blackface in the film\u00a0Tropic Thunder,\u00a0published in Robert Downey Jr. from Brat to Icon (2014),\u00a0and were instrumental in pushing me to complete a book chapter on ZZ Packer's short story \"Drinking Coffee Elsewhere\" that has been included in the collection Neo-Passing: Performing Identity After Jim Crow (2018).\u00a0I have received some of the best possible constructive feedback on my work while enjoying baked goods,\u00a0frothy beverages, and even lighthearted conversation. Very quickly, my colleagues have also become some of my truest, closest friends.",

A rare exception to this rule can be found in the many books of poetry published by juvenile (under the age of twenty-one) British authors during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

Because food systems are\u00a0a direct reflection of both availability and cultural choice, the analysis of\u00a0food remains can provide important clues about interrelationship between prehispanic populations and their environments. Since 1990 I have been part of a team of archaeologists excavating at\u00a0La Quemada\u00a0in the\u00a0Malpaso Valley of Zacatecas, Mexico. This is an interesting region\u00a0to study food systems\u00a0because the amount of rainfall is, at best, marginal for adequate agricultural production. So this region could provide\u00a0a great case study in human responses to climate change from a long-term perspective.",
        "DENDROCHRONOLOGY:\u00a0Research in this region is impeded by two things, precise measures of time to date cultural changes, and climate\u00a0reconstructions at high enough resolution\u00a0to assess the variability of environmental conditions over space and time. With the goal of addressing both these obstacles, my most recent research uses dendroarchaeology, a combination of tree-ring analysis and 14C-dating, to construct a high resolution tree-ring sequence that can be used to precisely date wood found at archaeogical sites. Together with students from Ithaca College, and\u00a0in\u00a0collaboration\u00a0with researchers from the\u00a0Tree-Ring Laboratory at Cornell University\u00a0, we\u00a0are collecting and studying prehistoric and historic wooden beams from\u00a0northern Mesoamerica with the goal of developing a chronological sequence that extends back from present to the 4th century A.D.\u00a0 Go to this\u00a0LINK\u00a0for an overview of our preliminary findings of Phase I of this project. By providing a deep time example\u00a0of a society\u00a0that may have been forced to adapt to unpredictable and fragile environmental conditions, this research has broad relevance to the rapid environmental changes we\u00a0are struggling with today.",
        "AQUAPONICS: While conventional food production methods produce large amounts of food, they also produce agricultural waste, deplete the soils, add chemical runoff to natural water sources, and take up large expanses of land.\u00a0 In contrast,\u00a0integrated agricultural systems, like aquaponics, are developed on the philosophy of mimicking nature's systems to create productive agriculture with minimum input and close to zero waste. Aquaponics uses\u00a0fish waste, which is naturally convertible to a form of nitrogen, to\u00a0nourish plants. Since the inception of the Ithaca College\u00a0Aquaponics Research Project, more than 40 students have conducted research to evaluate the ability of aquaponics to efficiently produce healthy food in a commercially and environmentally sustainable setting\u00a0and, as a bonus, has provided students and faculty with fresh herbs, fish (tilapia), and produce.\u00a0Here is a link to the\u00a0Ithaca College Project\u00a0with details on some of the student projects.",
        "What, you ask, does aquaponics have to do with Mesoamerican prehistory?\u00a0\u00a0Actually, aquaponics has it roots in a\u00a0technology called\u00a0chinampa\u00a0agriculture, which was used in Mesoamerica as the source of much of the food consumed by the Aztecs. The nutrient dense organics deposited by fish and plant debris in the canals was\u00a0used to fertilize the surrounding the raised fields. \u00a0These fields were so productive\u00a0that they could often harvest three crops on the same plot each year! \u00a0The connection between these two technologies is an example of the topics we address in my class \"Contemporary Applications of Ancient Agriculture\".",

        "The research conducted in my laboratory at Ithaca College focuses on recognition memory for emotional stimuli. The memory for emotional stimuli has long been found to differ from the memory for neutral stimuli. However, emotion's influence is now understood to be more complicated than purely a mechanism for enhancing memory.\u00a0 Several current researchers now contend that enhanced memory for emotional stimuli is actually mediated via the combination of several additional variables known to influence memory independent of any emotional significance (e.g., increased relatedness, attention and distinctiveness). Most commonly, our research fails to find that emotion enhances recognition memory accuracy and instead finds that the most robust influence is elevated false memory for emotional material. My research team and I conduct experimental research designed to assess if the variables forwarded to moderate and mediate emotion's influence on memory accuracy, and the respective theories, extend to emotion's influence on false memory formation.",
